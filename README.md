# 📊 EduPulse-AI Student Insight

**AI-powered KPI dashboard to detect and address student disengagement using feedback delay and content relevance metrics.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project helps educators track and respond to student disengagement by:

- Defining two custom KPIs:
  - **Feedback Lag Index (FLI)** – Measures delay between submission and feedback.
  - **Personal Relevance Score (PRS)** – Captures students’ perception of content relevance.
- Leveraging **Google Gemini (LLM)** to generate actionable insights.
- Offering an interactive **Streamlit app** with data input and trend visualizations.

## 🧠 Problem Addressed

Student engagement dropped by 30%, possibly due to:
- Slow feedback turnaround.
- Course material not feeling personally relevant.

This solution proposes two KPIs to monitor and resolve these root issues, using LLMs for quick, human-like analysis and intervention recommendations.
